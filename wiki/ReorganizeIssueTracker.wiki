#summary Proposal for improving GetPaid issue tracker organization

= Introduction =

Currently it is a mess and we aren't using labels very well. Also, not much consistent about the releases. Need to get it much better!


== Categories ==
 * checkout wizard
 * admin screen
 * ???

== Releases ==

We need a map of past and future, plus "trunk", for tags: 
 * trunk
 * 0.3
 * 0.6.0
 * 0.6.1
 * future ones???

=== Questions ===

 * Do we need to tag per Plone version? I think if we branch 2.5 vs 3, then yes...
