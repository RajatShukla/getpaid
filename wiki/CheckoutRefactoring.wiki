#summary Page for capturing requirements and architecture of refactored checkout for greater developer flexibility and offsite payment processor integration
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

GetPaid is a Plone eCommerce framework. GetPaid's architecture favors on-site entry of credit card information. Due to regulatory changes, it is now a common use case to outsource entry of credit card information. This is a proposal to redesign the GetPaid shopping cart and payment processor architecture to better support this, implement the redesign, and rewrite as many extant payment processor modules as is possible within the Google Summer of Code for 2009. This rework is necessary to GetPaid on road to 1.0. 


= Details =

==Architecture==

==Team==
  * Derek Richardson (student)
  * Brandon Rhodes (mentor)
  * _______ 

==Deliverables==

  * PloneGetPaid Version 0.8.0 Alpha with refactored checkout wizard
  * Documentation on upgrading, customization of wizard best practices, and writing a payment processor for the new wizard

==Process==

  *We will start work on a new branch of GetPaid while the refactoring of checkout wizard takes place. 
  * Once the wizard is working again, payment processors will be refactored to work as well so real testing can take place. 

==Use Cases==

  * As a developer, I want to add a field to the checkout wizard
  * As a site owner, I want my customers to enter in credit card information directly on the payment processor's website
  * As a site owner, I want to configure my payment processor settings to use on-site or off-site entry of credit card information
