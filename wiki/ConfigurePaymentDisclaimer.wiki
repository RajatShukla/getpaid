=Configure Payment Disclaimer=

In the Site Setup/GetPaid area, a "Disclaimer Text" tab offers ability to customize a disclaimer text that is presented during the checkout process. The box is a rich text box (so can add bold, formatting, or links). The page also includes a spot to link to the site's privacy policy. If filled out, both will show in the checkout process.
