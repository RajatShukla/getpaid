#summary Donation forms are a simple payable content object that can be added anywhere in the site.
#labels Phase-Design,AdminUI

Site Manager can go anywhere in the site and add a donation form. To do so, they click on the "add item to folder" button and select "Donation Form". [do we need to just provide a form that is payable? is this a custom content type?]

Fields:

    * A text area for describing the donation.
    * An amount of the donation that is set by the site user (options for set amounts as well as an open-ended amount.)
    * A submit and clear button.


Customizing Buttons / Labels:
Example site:

http://www.compassion.com/sponsor_a_child/waystosponsor/ChildBio.htm?Child=EI5010288

    * Provide an option for changing the buttons: "sign up for an event," "add to cart," "select this child," etc...


    Jon Stahl: Site admins will want to have a rich-text field so they can add arbitrary marketing content to the page.

    Jon Stahl: Site admins will also want the ability to add arbitrary information fields (e.g. checkboxes, radio buttons, text fields).  For example, a checkbox "Subscribe me to your email newsletter."  I suggest figuring out how to take advantage of PloneFormGen to provide this kind of flexibility.
