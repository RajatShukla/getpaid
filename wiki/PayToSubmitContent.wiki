#summary Use case where user has to pay to submit content (ie ad, article, job listing...)
#labels Phase-Design,EndUserUI,Deferred

An authenticated user on the site adds a piece of content of the type "Pay to Submit". The user can work on the content and save a draft. When the user is ready to finish the content, the user "Submits" the content. The content's state is changed to "Pending Payment" and a portal message at the top of the page notifies the user that "Payment is necessary to complete the submission. Please click here to pay now". The link leads to user to a checkout process. Upon successful completion of checkout, the workflow state on the object is updated to "published". If the checkout is unsuccessful or the user does not click the link, the object remains in the pending state and the user can return later to complete the checkout.
