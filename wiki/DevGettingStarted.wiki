Getting Started

Setting up a development environment is now easy thanks to our use of
zc.buildout ( http://python.org/pypi/zc.buildout )

To Get Started

checkout the getpaid.buildout infrastructure

 $ svn co https://getpaid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/getpaid.buildout

Run the following command from the getpaid.buildout directory:

 $ python bootstrap.py

This creates a few directories used by buildout. Then run:

 $ bin/buildout -v

The -v isn't necessary, but may make you feel better in the knowledge that
a lot is going on.

This will take a long time and use up to 200Mb of disk space. It will:

 - Create the 'parts' directory
 - Create a directory var where your Data.fs will live.
 - Download a Zope 2 tarball into parts/zope2.
 - Build Zope 2, using 'setup.py build_ext -i'
 - Build a Zope 2 instance in parts/instance
 - Install Plone 2.5's products into the Zope 2 instance
 - Setup the GetPaid Product/Package suite for Plone

If you've done this once, you can speed up the process by running

 $ bin/buildout -o

This tells buildout that you do not want it to go online and check for updates.

To start Zope 2, you can now do:

 $ bin/instance fg

If you wish to have an interactive python prompt that has all the packages
Zope is aware of, e.g. for testing purposes, you can run:

 $ bin/zopepy
