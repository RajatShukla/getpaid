=Getting Started=

Setting up a development environment is now easy thanks to our use of
zc.buildout ( http://python.org/pypi/zc.buildout )

==To Get Started==

Get a password to check out the code (you will need to log into a google account and go to http://code.google.com/hosting/settings to get a password). 

checkout the getpaid.buildout infrastructure 

 $ svn co https://getpaid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/getpaid.buildout

Run the following command from the getpaid.buildout directory:

 $ python bootstrap.py

This creates a few directories used by buildout. Then run:

 $ bin/buildout -v

The -v isn't necessary, but may make you feel better in the knowledge that
a lot is going on.

This will take a long time and use up to 200Mb of disk space. It will:

  * Create the 'parts' directory
  * Create a directory var where your Data.fs will live.
  * Download a Zope 2 tarball into parts/zope2.
  * Build Zope 2, using 'setup.py build_ext -i'
  * Build a Zope 2 instance in parts/instance
  * Install Plone 2.5's products into the Zope 2 instance
  * Setup the GetPaid Product/Package suite for Plone

If you've done this once, you can speed up the process by running

 $ bin/buildout -o

This tells buildout that you do not want it to go online and check for updates.

Next, remove the Zope egg files:
 $ rm -rf eggs/zope*

CMFonFive is a dependency not included in the bundle (hopefully someone can fix that?):
 $ svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/z3/CMFonFive/tag/CMFonFive-1.3.4/ develop-products/CMFonFive

To start Zope 2, you can now do:

 $ bin/instance fg

If you wish to have an interactive python prompt that has all the packages
Zope is aware of, e.g. for testing purposes, you can run:

 $ bin/zopepy

By default, the ZMI adminisration username/password is admin/admin.



== Troubleshooting ==

=== AccessControl/cAccessControl ===
{{{
internal error occured due to a bug in either zc.buildout or in a recipe being used:
AccessControl/cAccessControl.c:2312: error: ‘PROBLEM’ undeclared (first use in this function)
}}}

Seems to be caused by using the wrong version of Python. You can correct this by providing the full path to Python2.4 when running bootstrap.py

  $  /path/to/python24/python bootstrap.py
