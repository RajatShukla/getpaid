Outline:
Current Work | Recurring Billing | Code Assets | API Links | Pay Processors Overview

Current work:

        * 2Checkout will be done (Richard needs this), which is very international
        * Interest in Authorize.net also, which is what Kapil is planning on next processor to implement.
        * Some work in place is with Google Checkout (only usable for US), but this is on hold to have international, in-site processor option

    * TrustCommerce may already be available and be provided soon (they are very open source and have Python coders; NICE API; load-balancing; store user info on their site, not yours, etc.)
    * Let's get 3-4 processors to have a few options, document learnings, etc.

Recurring Billing

Not all processors support recurring payments; we can't do if processor doesn't support it...

Processors that support recurring payments:

    * 2checkout works well, automatically sends out notice
    * Authorize.net supports recurring billing, but for an extra fee (currently $10/m)
    * Paypal (standard and Pro)

Interface should ensure user understands that their pay processor will dictate if they can use that aspect of the product.

Payment Processors Code Assets

Authorize.net:

    * Kapil mentions a python tool for authorize.net processor (http://svn.zope.org/zc.authorizedotnet/)
    * Authorize.net (pure python library) svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.authorizedotnet - http://svn.zope.org/zc.authorizedotnet/trunk (from Zope Corp)
    * Authorize.net (cmf tool that posts and gets info via api + layer of plonemall integration): https://svn.sixfeetup.com/svn/public/SFUAuthorizeNetPlugin/trunk/

PayFloPro:

    * PayFloPro integration: see PremiumMembership product in collective from Nate

2Checkout:

    * ???((2CheckOut))

Trust Commerce:

    * Trust Commerce cmf tool: <link coming soon...> (from Tres and Chris McDonough)

PayPal

    * Paypal tool from 6ftup to post the paypal transaction data to Plone site: https://svn.sixfeetup.com/svn/public/PaypalManager/trunk/

GoogleCheckout:

    * GoogleCheckout integration worked on by Kapil, in GetPaid product

Other stuff can be found in zwarehouse:

    * Great collection of processors can be used. Find them in the code.

For each kind of payment processor, the necessary fields should be determined and integrated into the appropriate interface in GetPaid.

General Payment Processor Overview

Zwork, who developed plonemallpayment, and Ofer shared the following information:

There are two main types of payment processors:

   1. Standard payment processing:Â  the payment processor itself collects information from the shopper and then calls the payment service's backend. Has the advantage that the customer stays in your shop, but it is more work to develop + the merhant's shop must have https + a certificate
   2. Lighweight redirecting payment processors that redirect the customer to the payment provider's site from which you then get redirected back (e.g. paypal). Processors are easily to develop, and quicker to set up for a shop

Both types of payment processor consist of 3 parts:

   1. The payment setting (a user-editable in our case Archetype object) that stores the payment processors settings like merchant code, transaction code etc
   2. The processor itself
   3. The payment information (a persistent object that has the workflow (processing - success - failed - aborted)

There are currently a set of processors in plonemall:

    * paypal, (type 2)
    * qenta (an austrian cc provider, type 2) and
    * authorize.net (type 1), (from 6ftup)
    * and cash on delivery.
    * Purchase Order (see 6ftup)
