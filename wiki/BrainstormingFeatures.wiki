*Best Practices and Product management*
  * Package GetPaid eggs
  * Document customization philosophies and approaches (what are implications if you change things in checkout, for example). (Matt Halstead)
  * There has been a lot of work gone in to allow checkout forms to be customisable in a way that automatically stores gathered data onto an order. Other processes need to respect this by requesting schemas/interfaces and not assuming them, and in some instance requesting adapters - e.g. don't ask for "order.contact_information" ask for an "IContactInfo" adapter.
