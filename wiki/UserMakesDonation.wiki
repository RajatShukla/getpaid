#summary User Makes Donation
#labels Phase-Design,EndUserUI

= Introduction =

This will be addressed in two phases. First phase will be a base implementation using generic forms. Phase two will utilize PloneFormGen to work with an adapter to hook into the shopping cart and payment processor. 


== Present Implementation ==


Will follow existing workflow for regular products, except that the add product object will have some slightly different fields.

Fields: 

Product Name
Product Code
Product Description
Price
Free text field for amount
Rich text field
Quantity in basket
Buy Now button
Add to Basket button
Variants? (doubtful)


Payable items can be shippable, donateable, subscribeable, ie. they can have delivery options. - A donateable item must also be payable. 


==Future Implementation==

Will talk to PFG
User goes to donate -- either to a portlet or to a page. 

dropdown list with amounts listed plus additional item or write-in

continue to register or login form

go to review cart step, gives option to choose a payment processor,
modify / update cart / continue shopping / submit

go to cc information page -- will be dynamic based on payment processor
chosen

sends payment information to GC or Paypal, etc. (onsite or offsite)

returns user to plone confirmation page (receipt) or error notice

if there is an error, return to the cc page. do not save the cc info on
the roundtrip. do not charge twice. only click once!!! warning, room
for disclaimer.




for onsite payments, we pass out the cc data but don't store it. 
on page where they enter their cc info show the cart contents. 
change/update. send cc info via https.

for offsite payments, users get rerouted to plone.

if you are doing a donation and choose more than one donation 
item to add to your cart, you must actually create a cart and
send the info to the order management system; if you are doing a donation
that is just one donation item, it still creates a cart
