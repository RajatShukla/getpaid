GetPaid for Plone

Product Description: Version 0.1

Congratulations - you have installed GetPaid for Plone! GetPaid provides you basic commerce functionality (donations, shopping cart, checkout) out of the box while providing a flexible framework for creating custom ecommerce applications. 

How to Start Using GetPaid:

  GetPaid allows you to make any existing content in your site "buyable" (ie can be added to a cart and then purchased in the checkout). 

 - Install:  From the Plone Quick Installer, install PloneGetPaid. This will also add other tools that GetPaid needs. 

 - Setup: From the Plone Setup area, scroll down to the area for configuration of custom products and click on GetPaid. This will take you to the administrative screens for GetPaid. At a minimum, you will need to set what content types will be buyable (on the "Content Types" screen). 

 - Content: Go to the content of your site. When you click on the "action" menu while viewing a type of content you selected in the "content types" configuration, you will see options to make the content "buyable", a "donation", "shippable", etc. Select the option you want and then fill in the required fields (ie price). 

Payment Processors:

  GetPaid currently has two working payment processors: Authorize.net and a Test Processor (so you can experience the features before setting up your account). Other payment processors are also being integrated (GoogleCheckout, PayPal, currently). It is not the intent of this document to answer all your questions about payment processors. We suggest you ask on the development mailing list (see below) for more questions if you are unfamiliar with payment processors. 

How to Customize Functionality:

  Most functionality and features of GetPaid can be easily customized. To do so, you should be familiar with the Zope 3 Component Architecture. By writing your own adapters for GetPaid, you use a custom way of storing member data (ie a relational database), handling pricing (to implement specific discounting options, for example), and many other things.
