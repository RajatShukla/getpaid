**Creating Content Buyable Content for GetPaid**

This document assumes you have already set up a Plone site with
GetPaid. If you haven't, please read setup.txt

Now you need to make content buyable, donatable or shippable.

To do this, go to the "site setup" section of your site when viewed
through the Plone interface. In the "Content Types" sub-section, use
the arrows to move any appropriate content types to the "Selected"
column on the right of the Buyable, Donatable or Shippable sections.

Now, when you click on the "action" menu while viewing a type of
content you selected in the "content types" configuration, you will see
options to make the content "buyable", a "donation" or "shippable".

Select the option you want and then fill in the required fields (ie
price and/or other fields).
