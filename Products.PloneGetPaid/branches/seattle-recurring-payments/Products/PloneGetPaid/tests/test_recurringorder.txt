Order Management in GetPaid
===========================


First setup...
Install PloneGetPaid, whatever returns doesn't care...

  >>> portal.portal_quickinstaller.installProduct('PloneGetPaid')
  '...'

Getpaid's core functionality is represented as an order management
system.

Creating an Order
=================

  >>> from getpaid.core.order import Order
  >>> order = Order()

Carts and Line Items
====================

An order consists of line items. line items can come from a variety of
sources, content space payables, gift certificates, ie. anything we
potentially want to purchase:

  >>> from getpaid.core.item import RecurringLineItem
  >>> from Products.PloneGetPaid.interfaces import IRecurringPaymentMarker
  >>> from Products.Five.utilities import marker
  >>> marker.mark( portal, IRecurringPaymentMarker)

  >>> item = RecurringLineItem()

Let's set some attributes expected on line items. The only system invariant
here is that item_id should be unique when referring to purchasing the same
item:

  >>> from zope import component
  >>> from zope.app.intid.interfaces import IIntIds

  >>> item.item_id = "event-devtalk-2007-1"
  >>> item.name = "Event Registration"
  >>> item.cost = 25.00
  >>> item.quantity = 5
  >>> item.description = "Development Talk"
  >>> item.uid = component.getUtility( IIntIds ).register(portal)

Line Items are stored in a line item container, such as a shopping cart
of shipment:

  >>> from getpaid.core.cart import ShoppingCart
  >>> cart = ShoppingCart()
  >>> cart[ item.item_id ] = item

we can ask the cart how many items it has:

  >>> cart.size()
  5

Let's attach our cart to the order:

  >>> order.shopping_cart = cart

and now we can ask the order, its total price:

  >>> order.getSubTotalPrice()
  Decimal("125.0")

[ xxx talk about products and payable line items here ??]

Customer Information
====================

We need some additional information for an order to successfully process it:

  >>> from getpaid.core import payment
  >>> bill_address = payment.BillingAddress()
  >>> bill_address.bill_first_line = '1418 W Street NW'
  >>> bill_address.bill_city = 'Washington'
  >>> bill_address.bill_state = "DC"
  >>> bill_address.bill_country = "US"
  >>> bill_address.bill_postal_code = '20009'
  >>>
  >>>
  >>> contact_info = payment.ContactInformation()
  >>>
  >>> order.contact_information = contact_info
  >>> order.billing_address = bill_address

If we don't need to ship anything to the user, then we can forgo
setting a shipping address.
