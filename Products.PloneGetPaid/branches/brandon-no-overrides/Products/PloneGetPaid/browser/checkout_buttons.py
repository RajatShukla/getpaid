    If the store owner has activated on-site payment processing, then a
    plain "Checkout" button is shown that leads to the first page of the
    GetPaid checkout wizard.

    If the store owner has activated an off-site payment processor that
    needs the user sent off-site right at the beginning of the checkout
    process, then that processor's button will appear.

    or if they activated multiple off-site processors, then multiple
    buttons will be shown, allowing the shopper to choose.

    the store owner might want to activate one.
